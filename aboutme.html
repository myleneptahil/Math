    I am Mylene Arao-arao from the Philippines, math and coding tutor.
    I have been teaching programming and math to children from ages 7-to 16 years old
    for more than a year already. I train children to be full-stack developers and mathematicians at an
    early age. My teaching style is hands-on, easy, and fun. I teach kids
